                            The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
                            It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
                            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.
                            HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

                    <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] 
                            This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics,

                            1995: The Birth of JavaScript
                            Back in May 1995, the internet was becoming popular. The web back then was just static pages that were often text-heavy and ugly ðŸ˜Œ.

                            the best ones had images floated to the left or right. Not exciting when you compare it to the web today ðŸ¤”

                            The Web needed to be more dynamic. Animations, interactions, and other forms of small automation needed to be the future of the web. To achieve that future the web needed a scripting programming language that ran in the browser.

                            Brendan Eich a programmer at Netscape was given the job to make this possible and in just ten days he created the JavaScript programming language (originally called Mocha during its development and then changed to LiveScript )

                            On December 4, 1995, the internet saw the first release of the JavaScript programming language
